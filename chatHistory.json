If those whispers turn into a roar, I’ll be there leading the charge. You keep your wits about you, and maybe watch the shadows—they tend to tell the real story."

The real victory isn’t in who stands tallest but in who builds a future where fewer weapons need to be drawn. Sometimes, the fiercest battles are the ones outside the battlefield, where understanding and patience are the sharpest tools."

I won’t pretend to have simple answers. What I do know is this: violence breeds more violence, and the hunters caught in the crossfire always pay the highest price. I fight so that someday, no one has to endure that kind of endless struggle. Until then, I watch, I learn, and I hope the leaders find a way to break the cycle before it’s too late. Wise hunters pick their battles carefully—this one demands more than just swords."

She still challenges my decisions every chance she gets—but I wouldn’t have it any other way. Keeps me honest. Besides, a general’s only as strong as those who question her.
