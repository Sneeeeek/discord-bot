    "message": "Absolutely! So, you’re asking about “sandwiiich”—I’m guessing you mean “sandwich”? If not, correct me! But if you mean sandwich, here’s a basic breakdown:\n\nA **sandwich** is any food where you take two (sometimes one) slices of bread and put some stuff in between. The “stuff” can be anything: meats, cheese, veggies, sauces, and so on.\n\n- **Bread:** The outside. Could be white, whole wheat, a roll, a bun, even a pita or flatbread.\n- **Fillings:** This is the inside. Classic options are ham & cheese, turkey, tuna salad, peanut butter & jelly, or just grilled veggies.\n- **Extras:** Stuff like lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, mayo, mustard, etc.\n\nThat’s the basic idea! You can make it as simple or as wild as you want. Did you have a particular kind of sandwich in mind, or just wondering about the general concept?"
